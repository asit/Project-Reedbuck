Project Reedbuck is an online collaboration tool giving emphasis on purpose, without compromising on the freedom of the users. So, no more Project > Task binding. You are free to do any collaboration, as long as it has "something" related to it. Wait a sec, it does not allow you to start a collaboration just like that. You need to have topics, links, ideas or something as a base of using tools like chat and comment. Your whole collaboration landscape would be more like books and pages.

This project is still at a conceptual stage.

Preferred technology stack is:
==============================
ASP .Net as presentation layer technology
MarkLogic as the data repository and search engine
